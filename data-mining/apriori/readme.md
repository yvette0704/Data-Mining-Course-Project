Java implementation of the Apriori algorithm that is originally proposed by Agrawal et al.for frequent itemsets mining.

The program should be executable with 3 parameters: 
  the name of the input dataset file; 
  the threshold of minimum support count; 
  and the name of the output file.  
  
The minimum support count should be an integer.An itemset is frequent if its support count is larger or equal to this threshold. 

Provided test data file (the dataset T10I4D100K) 
The test dataset is a synthetic dataset that contains 100,000 transactions with an average size of 10 items from a set of 1000 distinct items.
